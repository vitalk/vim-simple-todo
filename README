VIM-SIMPLE-TODO

May be this is the smallest VIM plugin in the world. It adds some useful
mappings for manage simple TODO lists (example below) and nothing more.

INSTALL

Use your favorite installation method, but I recommend to use
pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and run:

cd .vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/vitalk/vim-simple-todo

USAGE

All this mappings use the <leader> key and they work the same on NORMAL and
INSERT modes. I prefer to use the coma as the <leader> key but fell free to set
your own.

,i      create new todo under cursor
,o      create new todo below current line
,O      create new todo above current line
,x      mark todo under cursor as done
,X      mark todo as undone

TODO

[x] publish to github
[ ] add folding
[ ] add syntax highlighting
[ ] add start, end timestamp

ISSUES

Don't hesitate to open GitHub Issues (https://github.com/vitalk/vim-simple-todo/issues)
for any bug or suggestions.
